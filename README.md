# JBLAS_MLP
A single dependency Java Machine Learning Package  

The goal for this project is for it to act as a structurally simple location to compile various implementations of machine learning algorithms, for later personal use. Primarily, however, I will use this package as an open source sandbox in which I can test different algorithms at the most basic relevent level.

I have attempted to organize the package in the easiest possible way for readibility down the line. All classes are within sub root level packages logical names. For example, the classes containing activation functions are in the "mlp.functions.activations" package. At the moment, the core of the package is the mlp.structures.Network class that contains the code for creating, training, and using neural network models.
